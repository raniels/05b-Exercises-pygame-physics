# 05b-Exercises-pygame-physics

In this assignment I added comments for the first 2 excercise depicting what the code does. For the 3rd excercise I had to add in the jumping animation. For the 4th excercise I had to add a 3rd music track and 2 more sound effects.

Up = snare
Left = beat
Down = drumsticks
Right = Argentina Drum
